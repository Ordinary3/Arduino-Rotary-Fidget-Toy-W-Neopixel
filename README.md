# Arduino-Rotary-Fidget-Toy-W-Neopixel
A fun fidget thing made with Arduino IDE with Neopixels

This is my first ever arduino project that uses a custom pcb but this project is still possible without it.

You would need these parts  
1x EC11 Rotary Encoder OR a EC11 Rotary Encoder with pcb  
1x Neopixel 16 Ring (Go ahead if you want to use other versions like the 24 and so on)  
1x Passive Buzzer  
2x Button (for Reset and Mode Change)  
1x Switch (Power On/Off)  
1x Charging Module (Ex. TP4056)  
1x Vibration Module
