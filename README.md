# Arduino Neopixel Rotary Fidget Toy
A fun fidget thing made with Arduino IDE with Neopixels  
designed using Kicad v.6

This is my first ever arduino project that uses a custom pcb but this project is still possible without it.

## Required Parts:  
1x Arduino Nano or LGT8F328p  
1x EC11 Rotary Encoder OR a EC11 Rotary Encoder with breakout pcb  
1x Neopixel 16 Ring (Go ahead if you want to use other versions like the 24 and so on)  
1x Passive Buzzer   
1x Vibration Module  
some awg 26 wires

Optional:
1x Switch (Power On/Off)  
1x Charging Module (Ex. TP4056)  
2x Button (for Reset and Mode Change)
